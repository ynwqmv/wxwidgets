Doing this for SIG-GAMES FIU to show that C++ is cooler than .NET :P

Also to show that writing a Tetris game even in C++ is relatively easy
and Wx is simple enough to learn.

Supposed to increase interest in C++ and linux development

Requires:
wxWidgets developer package and/or wxGTK package depending on your
distribution or OS. Tested in Linux (most distros) and Mac.

To run:
make
./Tetris
